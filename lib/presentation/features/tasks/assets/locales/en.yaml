        üéØ Marathon Mode is designed to help you focus on your tasks using the Pomodoro Technique.

        ## ‚è∞ The Pomodoro Technique
        A time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals. You can customize work and break durations to your preference:

        - **Common Patterns:**
          - 25 min work / 5 min break (Classic)
          - 50 min work / 10 min break (Extended)
        - After 4 work sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break
        - Choose what works best for you

        ## üéØ Benefits
        - Increases focus and concentration
        - Reduces mental fatigue
        - Maintains motivation through small wins
        - Creates a sense of urgency

        ## üí° Pro Tips
        - Use tags to track time across related tasks
        - Review tag time reports to understand your focus areas
        - Organize tasks with relevant tags before starting
        - Remove all distractions before starting
        - Use breaks to stretch or move around
        - Stay hydrated during breaks
        - Don't skip breaks - they're important!
        - Start with your most important task
