        🔄 Keep your tasks, habits, notes, settings etc. synchronized across all your devices. All data stays within your local network — nothing is sent to the cloud.

        ## ⚡ Quick & Secure Setup

        Connect your devices over the same Wi-Fi network using QR codes. Sync starts automatically after pairing.

        - 📱 **Mobile → Mobile:** One device must be in **Server mode** to allow pairing  
        - 💻 **Desktop → Mobile:** Desktop shows a QR code, mobile scans it  

        ## 📱 Mobile Devices

        Android devices can work in two different modes:

        - 🔍 **Client Mode:**  
          - Scans QR codes  
          - Connects to other devices to receive data  
        - 📡 **Server Mode:**  
          - Shows QR code for others to scan  
          - Sends data to connected devices  
          - Can be toggled via the Wi-Fi hotspot icon

        To sync between two mobile devices, one must be in **Server mode**.

        ## 💻 Desktop Devices

        Desktop apps always act as **Server** nodes:

        - 🖥️ Display a QR code for pairing  
        - ✅ Automatically accept incoming connections  
        - 🔄 Sync data in both directions  
        - 📊 Show live sync status

        ## 🛠️ Device Management

        Manage all connected devices from one place:

        - 📋 View connected devices  
        - ⏰ See last sync times  
        - 🔁 Trigger manual sync  
        - 🗑️ Remove old or unused devices

        ## 💡 Best Practices

        - 📶 Make sure all devices are on the same Wi-Fi network  
        - 📱 Keep apps open and active during sync  
        - 🧹 Remove devices you no longer use  
        - ⏱️ Check sync times to ensure everything is up to date
