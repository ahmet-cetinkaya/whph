        🔄 **What is Sync?**

        Sync keeps your habits, tasks, notes, and data updated across devices (phones, tablets, laptops, desktops) on the same Wi-Fi. No cloud or internet—data stays private and local.

        It's simple to use: Set it up once, and changes sync automatically or on demand. Switch devices seamlessly, like starting on your phone and finishing on your PC.

        ## 🔗 **Sync Modes**

        All devices support Client or Server modes for flexible syncing. Server leads (shares data), Clients join and exchange. Need at least one Server.

        - **Client Mode:** Connects to a Server to sync. Ideal for joining groups via QR or manual input.
        - **Server Mode:** Acts as hub; shows QR or string for others to connect.

        **Platform Notes:**
        - **Mobile:** Toggle via Wi-Fi hotspot icon. Server for portable hubs.
        - **Desktop (Default: Server):** Switch in Sync settings. Client for laptops syncing to main PCs.

        **Examples:** Mobile-to-mobile (one Server), desktop-to-mobile (either way), desktop-to-desktop (one Server, one Client).

        Switch modes in Sync settings; app remembers your choice.

        ## 🛠️ **Enabling Sync**

        Devices must share Wi-Fi; keep WHPH open.

        ### **QR Code Setup**
        1. Server: Start Server mode in Sync—QR appears.
        2. Client: "Add Device" > Scan QR.
        3. Auto-connects and syncs.

        Supports all combinations.

        ### **Connection String**
        1. Server: Copy string (e.g., "whph://IP:44040?...") from Sync.
        2. Client: "Add Device" > Manual > Paste string > Connect.

        No camera required.

        ### **Manual Entry**
        1. Server: Note IP/port (default 44040) from Connection Info.
        2. Client: "Add Device" > Manual > Enter IP, port, name > Test > Connect.

        **Desktop Clients:** Switch to Client mode first, then connect. Auto-syncs; switch back anytime.

        Enable auto-reconnect in settings for reliability.

        ## 📋 **Managing Devices**

        - **View:** See devices, sync times, status in Sync settings.
        - **Manual Sync:** Tap button per device.
        - **Remove:** Select and remove to stop syncing.

        ## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

        **Connection Issues:**
        1. Same Wi-Fi? No VPNs.
        2. Restart app.
        3. Verify Server mode.
        4. Test without firewall.

        **No Devices?**
        - Stable Wi-Fi, no proxies.
        - Refresh scan.
        - Use manual IP.

        **Sync Fails/Timeouts:**
        1. Manual sync.
        2. Match app versions.
        3. Wait for large data.

        **Firewall (Port 44040):**

        If connections aren't working, your computer's firewall might be blocking the sync signal. Open port 44040 to let devices communicate locally—it's safe for your home network.

        **Windows (GUI):**
        1. Open Defender Firewall > Advanced > Inbound Rules > New Rule.
        2. Port > TCP > 44040 > Allow > All profiles > Name "WHPH Sync" > Finish.

        **Windows (Admin CMD):**
        ```
        netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WHPH Sync" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=44040
        ```

        **Linux (UFW):**
        ```
        sudo ufw allow 44040/tcp && sudo ufw reload
        ```

        Tips: Restart router, use private networks. Re-pair if "not found" errors.
