        🔄 Synchronize your data across all devices on the same Wi-Fi network. No cloud storage - all data stays local.

        ## 🔗 Quick Setup

        Connect devices using QR codes:
        - 📱 **Mobile → Mobile:** One device in **Server mode** 
        - 💻 **Desktop → Mobile:** Desktop shows QR code, mobile scans it

        ## 📱 Mobile Device Modes

        - 🔍 **Client Mode:** Scans QR codes and receives data
        - 📡 **Server Mode:** Shows QR code and sends data (toggle via Wi-Fi hotspot icon)

        Two mobile devices need one in **Server mode** to sync.

        ## 💻 Desktop Devices

        Always act as **Server** nodes:
        - 🖥️ Display QR code for pairing
        - ✅ Auto-accept connections
        - 🔄 Two-way sync
        - 📊 Live sync status

        ## 🛠️ Device Management

        - 📋 View connected devices
        - ⏰ See last sync times
        - 🔁 Manual sync
        - 🗑️ Remove old devices
