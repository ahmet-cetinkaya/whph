        üîÑ Synchronize your data across all devices on the same Wi-Fi network. No cloud storage - all data stays local.

        ## üîó Quick Setup

        Connect devices using QR codes:
        - üì± **Mobile ‚Üí Mobile:** One device in **Server mode** 
        - üíª **Desktop ‚Üí Mobile:** Desktop shows QR code, mobile scans it

        ## üì± Mobile Device Modes

        - üîç **Client Mode:** Scans QR codes and receives data
        - üì° **Server Mode:** Shows QR code and sends data (toggle via Wi-Fi hotspot icon)

        Two mobile devices need one in **Server mode** to sync.

        ## üíª Desktop Devices

        Always act as **Server** nodes:
        - üñ•Ô∏è Display QR code for pairing
        - ‚úÖ Auto-accept connections
        - üîÑ Two-way sync
        - üìä Live sync status

        ## üõ†Ô∏è Device Management

        - üìã View connected devices
        - ‚è∞ See last sync times
        - üîÅ Manual sync
        - üóëÔ∏è Remove old devices

        ## üî• Firewall Setup (Port 44040)

        ### üêß **Linux (UFW)**
        ```
        sudo ufw allow 44040/tcp
        ```

        7. Select **Allow the connection** and click **Next**
        8. Check all profiles (Domain, Private, Public) and click **Next**
        9. Enter a name like **WHPH Sync Port 44040** and click **Finish**

        **Via Command Prompt (as Administrator):**
        ```
        netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WHPH Sync Port 44040" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=44040
        ```
